# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

## Hello

I'm a designer learning to code. I spent way too much time making this look like the figma file. :) At the same time I'm happy I managed to get a very lean javascript solution working.

Questions I had while working on this project:
- Is the my js solutions working well?
- Is normalize.css still needed or used, or do we have better alternatives?
- I repurposed a form with radiobuttons, is that a good practice from an accessibility pov?
